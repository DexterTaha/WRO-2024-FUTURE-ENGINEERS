  <strong>Differential System</strong>
</p>


Our LEGO robot features a gearbox with a ratio of 1.6. This gearbox contains a differential, a gear train with three drive shafts.
One key property of the differential is that the rotational speed of one shaft is the average of the speeds of the others. 
This mechanism is commonly used in motor vehicles to enable the wheels at each end of a drive axle to rotate at different speeds, particularly when cornering. 
Differentials also find applications in clocks, analog computers, and various mechanical systems where different rotational speeds or gear ratios are required. 
In many motor vehicle differentials, a gearing reduction is achieved by having fewer teeth on the pinion gear than the ring gear.

  <strong>Differential operation while turning left:</strong>
  Input torque is applied to the ring gear (purple), which rotates the carrier (purple) at the same speed. The left sun gear (red) provides more resistance than the right sun gear (yellow), which causes the planet gear (green) to rotate anti-clockwise.
This produces slower rotation in the left sun gear and faster rotation in the right sun gear, resulting in the car's right wheel turning faster (and thus travelling farther) than the left wheel.

## Differential operation while driving in a straight line:

  <strong>Differential operation while driving in a straight line:</strong>
  Input torque is applied to the ring gear (purple), which rotates the carrier (purple) at the same speed. 
  When the resistance from both wheels is the same, the planet gear (green) doesn't rotate on its axis (although the gear and its pin are orbiting due to being attached to the carrier). 
  This causes the sun gears (red and yellow) to rotate at the same speed, resulting in the car's wheels also rotating at the same speed.
