The steering system of our self-driving robot utilizes a gear rack mechanism made of LEGO pieces.
This mechanism allows the robot to achieve a full range of motion, requiring 360 degrees of rotation from the steering motor.
The gear rack is positioned to engage with a gear attached to the motor, translating the rotational motion of the motor into linear motion along the rack.
This linear motion is then used to steer the robot's wheels, enabling it to move from the top left to the top right and navigate effectively.
The use of LEGO pieces ensures a lightweight and robust steering system suitable for our robot's needs in the World Robot Olympiad competition.

## The rack and gear system
![RACK AND GEAR](https://github.com/DexterTaha/WRO-2024-FUTURE-ENGINEERS/assets/130682580/f109e214-ce08-4ed0-9800-5918b34b84f6)

The rack and gear system is a mechanism that converts rotational motion into linear motion. It consists of two main components: a gear (often called a pinion) and a rack.

Rack: The rack is a straight bar with teeth along its length. It resembles a gear that has been "unrolled" into a straight line. The teeth on the rack mesh with the teeth of the gear.

Gear: The gear, or pinion, is a circular disc with teeth around its circumference. When the gear rotates, its teeth engage with the teeth of the rack, causing the rack to move linearly.

Mechanism: As the gear rotates, it pushes or pulls the rack, depending on the direction of rotation. This linear motion can be used to move or actuate other components of a system.

In the context of your self-driving robot, the gear attached to the steering motor rotates, engaging with the teeth of the rack. This engagement causes the rack to move linearly, which is then used to steer the robot's wheels, allowing it to turn and navigate. The 360-degree rotation requirement means that the gear must rotate fully to achieve the full range of motion needed for steering the robot from the top left to the top right.
