The steering system of our self-driving robot utilizes a gear rack mechanism made of LEGO pieces.
This mechanism allows the robot to achieve a full range of motion, requiring 360 degrees of rotation from the steering motor.
The gear rack is positioned to engage with a gear attached to the motor, translating the rotational motion of the motor into linear motion along the rack.
This linear motion is then used to steer the robot's wheels, enabling it to move from the top left to the top right and navigate effectively.
The use of LEGO pieces ensures a lightweight and robust steering system suitable for our robot's needs in the World Robot Olympiad competition.
