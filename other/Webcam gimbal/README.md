  <strong>Webcam gimbal</strong>
  Our webcam gimbal is equipped with two motors that have encoders, providing precise feedback and control over the movement of the webcam in both the Y (vertical) and X (horizontal) axes. 
This setup allows us to adjust the orientation of the webcam with great accuracy, enabling us to capture a wide range of angles and perspectives. 
The gimbal's design ensures stability and smooth operation, making it ideal for tracking objects or capturing smooth, panning shots in our robotics projects.
