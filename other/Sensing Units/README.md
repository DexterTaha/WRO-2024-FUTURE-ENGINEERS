  <strong>Sensing Units</strong>
</p>

Our robot is equipped with a comprehensive sensing system that enhances its navigation and control capabilities. It includes three ultrasonic sensors that detect walls and obstacles, providing crucial information for navigation and obstacle avoidance. Additionally, we have two color sensors that detect lane lines, aiding in precise path following and alignment. 

Moreover, our robot features two gyroscopes that calculate speed, velocity, angular velocity, and angle of rotation, providing essential data for maintaining stability and control during movement. These sensors contribute to accurate motion tracking and orientation adjustments. 

Furthermore, we utilize encoders to measure the speed of the robot's Motors and wheels. This information is vital for precise movement control, allowing us to implement closed-loop control strategies that ensure the robot moves accurately according to its programming. Overall, these sensing units play a critical role in enhancing the robot's performance and autonomy.
