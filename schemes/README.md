# Schemes Folder

Welcome to the **Schemes** folder for our WRO Future Engineers competition project! This folder contains all the essential schematics, diagrams, and documentation related to the various components of our robot.

## Overview

This folder is organized to help team members and collaborators easily find and understand the different parts of our robot design. Below is a brief description of the contents:

- **Mechanical Parts**: Schematics and CAD diagrams for the robot's mechanical components.
- **Electronic Components**: Circuit diagrams and layouts for the electronic components.
- **Software Flowcharts**: Diagrams detailing the software logic and flow.
- **Assembly Guides**: Step-by-step instructions for assembling different parts of the robot.
- **Bill of Materials (BOM)**: Detailed lists of all the parts and materials used, including quantities and sources.
- **Testing and Calibration Procedures**: Documentation on how to test and calibrate the robot's components to ensure optimal performance.

## Purpose

The purpose of this folder is to provide a centralized location for all the design and assembly documents necessary for our robot. This ensures that all team members have access to the information they need to work on different aspects of the project.

## How to Use

- **Browse the Subfolders**: Navigate through the subfolders to find specific schematics, diagrams, or documentation.
- **Follow Assembly Guides**: Use the assembly guides to correctly put together the robot's parts.
- **Check the BOM**: Refer to the Bill of Materials to verify all necessary components are accounted for.
- **Review Testing Procedures**: Follow the testing and calibration procedures to ensure the robot functions correctly.
